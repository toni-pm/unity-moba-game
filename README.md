MOBA Game | Unity | 2017
===========================

Project done in class in 2017. I hope to be able to continue it one day.

After more than 5 years it still "works".

- **Can only be played on a local network.**
- **Authentication server has been disabled, so you can login without register, just enter a nickname.**
- **Character renders have been disabled, now they are colored cylinders ðŸ˜‚**

Inside `Builds` folder you can find `zip` files for each version, these compressed files includes the builds with an `exe` to execute the game.

To play:

- Sign in with a cool nickname
- Create a room or join an existing one
- Choose character
- Wait for the rest of the players
- Start game
- Win

The game consists in destroy the enemy nexus, for this you must cooperate to eliminate their defensive towers first.

You will find neutral enemies scattered around the map.
